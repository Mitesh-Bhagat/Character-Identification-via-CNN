# About the Project

This project is a Character Identification System built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten English letters (A–Z) and digits (0–9). It demonstrates a complete deep-learning workflow from data preparation to real-time prediction.

### Project Overview
* Uses a combined dataset of handwritten letters and MNIST digits
* Total dataset size: 440,000+ images
* All images are resized to 28×28 grayscale
* Pixel values normalized for efficient model training
* Achieved ~99% accuracy using a custom CNN architecture
* Includes a real-time prediction application using OpenCV

### Model Details

* Built using Keras + TensorFlow
* CNN architecture includes:
    * Conv2D layers for feature extraction
    * MaxPooling layers for spatial reduction
    * Batch Normalization for stable training
    * Dense layers for final classification
* Model outputs top predictions with confidence scores

### Application Interface

* Real-time drawing board created with OpenCV
* Users draw characters using mouse input
* System crops the drawing, preprocesses it, and sends it to the model
* Predictions displayed instantly on screen

### About the Uploaded Files

* The notebook files in this repository are only for showcasing the main logic, structure, and working steps of the project.
* These files explain how data is prepared, how the CNN is trained, and how the application functions.
* They are lightweight and meant for review or demonstration.
